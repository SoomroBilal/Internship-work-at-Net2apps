# Internship-work-at-Net2apps
This repository contains all of work that I did at Net2apps during my internship period. During the 2 months period, I learned a great deal about things. My python development skill excelled to a great degree. I was given tasks from easy to advanced level which included scrapping, automating SAP and validating the data from SAP to Sheets.
